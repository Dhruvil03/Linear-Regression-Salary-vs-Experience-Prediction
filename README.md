# Linear Regression: Salary vs Experience Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict salary based on years of experience. The model demonstrates the fundamental concepts of supervised learning and linear relationships between variables.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- **Years of Experience**: Independent variable (X)
- **Salary**: Dependent variable (Y)

## Model Implementation

### Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and tools

### Key Steps
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Load the salary-experience dataset
   - Handle any missing values if present
   - Split features and target variables

2. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Typical ratio: 80% training, 20% testing

3. **Model Training**
   - Create Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
   - Fit the model on training data
   - Learn the linear relationship: `Salary = β₀ + β₁ × Experience`

4. **Prediction**
   - Make predictions on test data
   - Generate salary predictions for given experience values

5. **Visualization**
   - Plot training data points
   - Plot test data points
   - Display the regression line
   - Compare actual vs predicted values

## Model Features
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Type**: Supervised Learning (Regression)
- **Input**: Years of Experience
- **Output**: Predicted Salary

## Visualizations
The notebook includes plots showing:
- Training data distribution
- Test data distribution
- Linear regression line fitted to the data
- Relationship between experience and salary

## Key Insights
- Linear relationship between years of experience and salary
- Model learns the trend from training data
- Visualization helps understand model performance
- Simple yet effective approach for salary prediction

## Usage
1. Load the dataset
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially
3. View the training and test data plots
4. Analyze the linear regression results

## Future Improvements
- Add feature scaling if needed
- Include more features (education, location, industry)
- Try polynomial regression for non-linear relationships
- Implement cross-validation
- Add detailed model evaluation metrics
